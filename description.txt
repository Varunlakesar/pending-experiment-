anvas Freehand Drawing Tool

This is a simple web app where you can draw freely on a canvas using your mouse. Its made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You just click and drag your mouse and it draws lines in real time, kinda like using a pen on paper.

Features:

Draw in real time as you move the mouse.

Lines are blue and smooth, and you can change size if you want.

Drawing stops when you release mouse or leave the canvas.

Very simple and light, works in any browser.

What I learned:

How to use canvas to draw instead of SVG.

Handling mouse events like mousedown, mousemove, mouseup.

How to draw lines dynamically with JS.

Made my first interactive web drawing app.

Technologies used:

HTML5 for the canvas and page.

CSS3 for style.

JavaScript for drawing and events.
